Welcome to the first post on my new GitHub Pages blog! ðŸŽ‰

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Iâ€™ll be using it to share updates, tutorials, and cool experiments.

## Why this blog?

I've always wanted a simple, version-controlled space to write and share ideas. GitHub Pages makes it super easy to set one up.

Stay tuned for more content â€” and feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo/issues) if you have questions or suggestions.
